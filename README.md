## Digital Futures Data Engineering Academy Capstone Project
Author: Samuel Witt

This project extracts the 2025 UK house price paid data from the UK government website, transforms it and loads it into a database. A streamlit application uses this database to visualise 2025 residential UK house price statistics.

USER STORY 1

As a Data Analyst,
I want to access a database with UK house price data,
So that I can create a streamlit app visualising UK house price data.
```
